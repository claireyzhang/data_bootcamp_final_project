# data_bootcamp_final_project

This project was completed by Claire Zhang in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof-has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography. 

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substatially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

### Project Description

This project aims to understand how certain factors affect student performance within higher education, which I am measuring by examining the proportion of students that graduate as well as their earnings after graduation. In looking at all these factors, I hope to determine if certain elements are more influential in determining the overall success of students.

[College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) draws most of its data from IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), compiling statistics varying from average cost to demographics to location. The scorecard was created to increase transparency regarding higher education and to help prospective students weigh out the costs and values of each school. 

The factors that I will examine are control (public, private nonprofit, private for-profit) and ranking. 

This project will include: 

* Basic statistics about 4-year universities from the 2016-2017 academic year

* Comparisons amongst schools based on factors above

* Visualization of the relationship between each factor and graduation rates/earnings
